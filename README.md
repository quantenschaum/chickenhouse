arduino based automatic chicken house door controller

The automatic chicken house door controller opens and closes the door of a
chicken house based on daylight and time. It opens the door in morning and closes it 
in the evening, fully automatically. The controller drives relais, to which a motor for
the hatch is attached. The controller may be hooked up to the internet using the 
arduino ethernet shield, which allows the device to be remote controlled.

Additionally some extra sensors like a temperature and/or humidity sensors may be attached 
and there are spare relais channels, that can be used to switch other devices like light 
or a heater. So, the door controller can also serve as a weather monitor.
